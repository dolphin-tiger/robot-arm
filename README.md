# robot-arm
  robot-arm is a 5th grade GT class project to build and control a robotic arm utilizing an Arduino controller, servo motors, and analog joysticks. The original goal of the project was to learn how coding works, with the specific request to start from scratch as opposed to modifying something existing.  We mostly accomplished that task here by creating our own ncludes but also learned why at some point it is impractical and undesirable to recreate all the code from scratch. This project has a good mixture of scratch code along with libraries like from Adafruit and other even more obvious like <Arduino.h>.
